Included Files :
* twin_primes.cpp
* Output
* README
* Makefile

Running Instructions :
In the directory of containing the folder 'soln' (containing twin_primes.cpp and Output) and the file called Makefile,
use the command 'make' to run through all '5' tests. 
To use user-input on the code, change directory into the 'soln' and use the command './Output' and manually type in
your inputs

Notes and Assumptions :
This file twin_primes.cpp contains a function isPrime() that takes in an arguement of integer n
and checks to see if n is a prime number through seeing if there is a remainder after dividing 
the integer n with 2.

This file contains another function called twinPrimes which is a void function that does not return anything.
Rather, it creates a pair of two prime numbers that are seperated with the second prime number being two more 
greater than the first prime number. The length of the pair goes on for an integer value of k.
